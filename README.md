# UI Style Guide in HTML

<strong> About </strong><br/>
UI Style Guides are a design and development tool that brings cohesion to a digital product's user interface. Records all of the design elements that occur within a product. List crucial UI components such as buttons, typography, color, inputs, icons, etc.


<strong> How was it done</strong><br/>
HTML, SASS, Javascript and Bootstrap<br/>
Developed by me (Marconip) and <a href="https://github.com/KalebeMatos">Kalebe Matos</a>

I designed and structure the codes<br/>
Kalebe Matos gave me a nice help in Javascript


<strong> How it works </strong><br/>
You must edit the elements of this file according to the project you have done (website, system, application, etc.).<br/>
Remembering that this is a basic style guide template can be edited as needed.<br/>
The base files you should edit are:<br/>
"_variables.scss" for variables such as colors, sizes, fonts, etc;<br/>
"style-guide.html" for exchange images and inserting or deleting elements if required;<br/>
... and any other files if needed.<br/>
Automatically it will put the technical details in the "details" link


<strong> Importance of UI Style Guide </strong><br/>
- Prevents errors against visual inconsistencies and interactions;<br/>
- Generates a mockup with interaction feedbacks (visual demo);<br/>
- Generates visual patterns and consistency guide;<br/>
- Generates documentation being reference for next interfaces to be developed;<br/>
- Ensures to generate all components needed for the project;<br/>
- Save time on front-end development using pre-made files;<br/>
- Helps in good use of Bootstrap;<br/>
